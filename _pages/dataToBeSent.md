## What Data will be sent to Azure FarmBeats?

FarmBeats is currently an EnviroMonitor-based system. Therefore, only
data related to EnviroMonitors (EMs) will be sent to FarmBeats. This
applies to any and all EMs that:

  - you own and are registered under your account
  - that are pro-shared to your account.

The graphic below shows where you can view both the Owned as well as
Shared stations.
